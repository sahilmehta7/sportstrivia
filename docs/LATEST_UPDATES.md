# Latest Updates - Quiz Attempt Limits

## 🚦 NEW FEATURE: Quiz Attempt Caps & Reset Messaging

**What’s new:** Admins can now cap the number of attempts per user, choose a reset cadence, and players see clear banners/countdowns when they’re close to (or have hit) the limit.

- Admin create/edit forms include an “Attempt Limits” card with toggle, input, and cadence dropdown that locks to `NEVER` for non-recurring quizzes.
- Quiz list view displays an “Attempt Cap” column summarising the configured rule (`3 attempts / daily`, `Unlimited`, etc.).
- `/api/attempts` returns attempt-limit metadata with every start and now emits `ATTEMPT_LIMIT_REACHED` payloads containing `limit`, `period`, and `resetAt`.
- Player quiz detail and play flows surface a new `AttemptLimitBanner` component with progression dots, UTC countdown, and lockout messaging.

> ✨ See `docs/QUIZ_ATTEMPT_LIMITS.md` for the full breakdown, testing checklist, and rollout notes.
