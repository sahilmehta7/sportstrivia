## How Randomization Works

### Question Order Randomization

**Code Location**: `app/api/attempts/route.ts` (lines 106-109)

```typescript
// BEFORE randomization
selectedQuestions = [Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5]

// IF quiz.randomizeQuestionOrder === true
selectedQuestions = selectedQuestions.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);

// AFTER randomization  
selectedQuestions = [Q3, Q1, Q5, Q2, Q4]  ‚Üê Random order
```

**Effect:**
- User A attempt #1: [Q3, Q1, Q5, Q2, Q4]
- User A attempt #2: [Q2, Q5, Q1, Q4, Q3] ‚Üê Different!
- User B attempt #1: [Q4, Q2, Q1, Q3, Q5] ‚Üê Different!

### Answer Order Randomization

**Code Location**: `app/api/attempts/route.ts` (lines 146-151)

```typescript
// For EACH question
answers: q.answers.sort((a, b) => 
  q.randomizeAnswerOrder 
    ? Math.random() - 0.5              // Shuffle randomly
    : a.displayOrder - b.displayOrder  // Keep original order
)
```

**Effect:**
```
Question: "Who won 2023 NBA Championship?"

Attempt #1:
  A) Lakers
  B) Denver Nuggets ‚Üê Correct
  C) Heat
  D) Celtics

Attempt #2:
  A) Heat
  B) Celtics
  C) Lakers  
  D) Denver Nuggets ‚Üê Correct (different position!)

Attempt #3:
  A) Denver Nuggets ‚Üê Correct (different position again!)
  B) Heat
  C) Lakers
  D) Celtics
```

## Advanced Features

### A. Topic Hierarchy Auto-Inclusion

When you filter by "Cricket", it **automatically includes**:
- Cricket questions
- Batting questions (child)
- Bowling questions (child)
- Any future sub-topics

**Implementation**: Recursive topic traversal
```typescript
async function getDescendantTopics(parentId: string) {
  const children = await prisma.topic.findMany({ where: { parentId } });
  const descendants = [...children];
  
  for (const child of children) {
    const childDescendants = await getDescendantTopics(child.id);
    descendants.push(...childDescendants);
  }
  
  return descendants;
}
```

### B. Flexible Question Selection

**Three Modes:**

1. **FIXED** - Specific questions in specific order
   ```json
   {
     "questionSelectionMode": "FIXED",
     "randomizeQuestionOrder": false  // Or true
   }
   ```

2. **TOPIC_RANDOM** - Pull N questions from specific topics/difficulties
   ```json
   {
     "questionSelectionMode": "TOPIC_RANDOM",
     "topicConfigs": [
       {"topicId": "cricket", "difficulty": "EASY", "questionCount": 5},
       {"topicId": "cricket", "difficulty": "HARD", "questionCount": 3}
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **POOL_RANDOM** - Random selection from quiz pool
   ```json
   {
     "questionSelectionMode": "POOL_RANDOM",
     "questionCount": 10  // Pick 10 random from pool
   }
   ```

### C. Per-Question Configuration

Each question can have:
```json
{
  "randomizeAnswerOrder": true,   // This question shuffles
  "timeLimit": 30,                // 30 seconds for this question
  "hint": "Optional hint text",   // Shown if quiz.showHints = true
  "explanation": "Why this is correct"
}
```
