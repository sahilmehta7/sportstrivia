# Sports Trivia Platform — Implementation Overview

This checklist has been consolidated into the living documentation set. Refer to:

- `docs/CURRENT_PROJECT_STATUS.md` — executive status, roadmap, metrics
- `docs/FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` — detailed feature matrix
- `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` — exhaustive endpoint catalogue (70 handlers)

Those files are now the single source of truth for production readiness. Update them when features ship or requirements change.
