# Profile Page Redesign & Badge System Fix

## Overview
This document covers two major improvements:
1. **Badge Awarding System Fix** - Fixed missing badges and name mismatches
2. **Profile Page Redesign** - Modern tabbed interface with better organization

## 1. Badge System Fix

### Issues Found

#### A. Missing Badges in Database
The badge service (`badge.service.ts`) checked for badges that weren't seeded:
- ‚ùå "Lightning Fast" - Not in seed.ts
- ‚ùå "Comeback Kid" - Not in seed.ts

#### B. Name Mismatch
- Seed file: "Perfect Score"
- Badge service: "Perfect Round"
- Result: Badge never awarded because names didn't match

### Solution

#### Updated `prisma/seed.ts`

1. **Fixed Name Mismatch**
   ```typescript
   // Changed from "Perfect Score" to "Perfect Round"
   const _perfectScoreBadge = await prisma.badge.upsert({
     where: { name: "Perfect Round" },
     create: {
       name: "Perfect Round",
       description: "Achieve a perfect score on any quiz",
       imageUrl: "/badges/perfect-score.png",
       criteria: { type: "perfect_score", count: 1 },
     },
   });
   ```

2. **Added Missing Badges**
   ```typescript
   // Lightning Fast Badge
   const _lightningFastBadge = await prisma.badge.upsert({
     where: { name: "Lightning Fast" },
     create: {
       name: "Lightning Fast",
       description: "Answer a question correctly in under 2 seconds",
       imageUrl: "/badges/lightning-fast.png",
       criteria: { type: "fast_answer", seconds: 2 },
     },
   });

   // Comeback Kid Badge
   const _comebackKidBadge = await prisma.badge.upsert({
     where: { name: "Comeback Kid" },
     create: {
       name: "Comeback Kid",
       description: "Recover from two incorrect answers and still pass a quiz",
       imageUrl: "/badges/comeback-kid.png",
       criteria: { type: "comeback", minIncorrect: 2 },
     },
   });
   ```

3. **Updated Seed Summary**
   - Changed from "8 badges" to "10 badges"

### Badge Criteria Mapping

All badges now properly match between seed and service:

| Badge Name | Criteria | When Awarded |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| Early Bird | First quiz | Complete 1 quiz |
| Quiz Master | Multiple quizzes | Complete 10 quizzes |
| Perfect Round | Perfect score | Achieve 100% on any quiz |
| Streak Warrior | Daily streak | Maintain 7-day streak |
| Social Butterfly | Friends | Add 5 friends |
| Challenger | Challenge wins | Win 5 challenges |
| Reviewer | Reviews | Write 10 quiz reviews |
| Lightning Fast | Speed | Answer correctly in <2 seconds |
| Comeback Kid | Resilience | Pass quiz after 2+ wrong answers |

### How to Apply Fix

1. **Re-run database seed:**
   ```bash
   npm run prisma:seed
   ```

2. **Badges will now be awarded correctly when:**
   - User completes their first quiz ‚Üí "Early Bird"
   - User gets perfect score ‚Üí "Perfect Round"
   - User answers quickly ‚Üí "Lightning Fast"
   - And all other criteria...
