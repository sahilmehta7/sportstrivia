## 🔒 Safety Features

### Delete Protection

2. ✅ Has sub-topics? → Block deletion
3. ✅ Used in quizzes? → Block deletion

**Visual Indicators:**
- Delete button disabled if protected
- Warning message in dialog

- Instructions for cleanup

**Example Warnings:**
```
⚠️ This topic cannot be deleted because:
• It has 15 question(s)
• It has 3 sub-topic(s)
• It is used in 5 quiz configuration(s)

Remove all dependencies before deleting.
```

### Circular Reference Prevention

**Validation:**

- ✅ Cannot set child as parent
- ✅ Cannot set grandchild as parent
- ✅ Prevents any circular references

**Implementation:**
Server-side validation checks entire descendant chain.

### Unique Constraints

**Enforced:**
- ✅ Topic name must be unique
- ✅ Topic slug must be unique
- ✅ Clear error messages if duplicate

---

## 💡 Smart Features

### Auto-Slug Generation

```typescript
// As you type name
"NBA Champions" → "nba-champions"
"Cricket - Batting" → "cricket-batting"
"Test Topic 123" → "test-topic-123"
```

### Level Calculation

```typescript
// Automatic level based on parent
No parent → Level 0
Parent at L0 → Level 1
Parent at L1 → Level 2
// etc.
```

### Cascading Updates

When you change a topic's parent:
```
Before:
Sports (L0) → Cricket (L1) → Batting (L2)

Move Cricket to Basketball:
Sports (L0)
Basketball (L0) → Cricket (L1) → Batting (L2)

Result:
- Cricket stays L1 (new parent is L0)
- Batting stays L2 (relative to Cricket)
- All descendants auto-update!
```

## 📊 Topic Statistics

Each topic shows:

2. **Sub-topics Count** - Number of child topics
3. **Quiz Usage** - How many quizzes use this topic

**Usage Information:**
- Helps identify important topics
- Prevents accidental deletion
- Shows content distribution
