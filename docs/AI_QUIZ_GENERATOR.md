## ⚠️ Best Practices

### Content Quality

**Do:**
- ✅ Review generated questions for accuracy
- ✅ Verify facts and dates
- ✅ Check answer correctness
- ✅ Ensure hints are helpful
- ✅ Validate explanations

**Don't:**
- ❌ Blindly trust all AI-generated content
- ❌ Skip fact-checking
- ❌ Ignore obviously wrong answers

### Generation Strategy

**Good:**
- Generate 5-10 questions at a time
- Review and test before publishing
- Use specific topics (not too broad)
- Provide sport context when possible

**Avoid:**
- Generating 50 questions at once (harder to review)
- Very broad topics ("Sports" is too generic)
- Relying solely on AI without human review

### Cost Management

**Tips:**
- Start small (5-10 questions)
- Review quality before scaling up
- Cache/reuse good generations
- Edit and regenerate individual questions rather than whole quiz

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key is not configured"

**Solution:**
1. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` to `.env` file

### "Failed to parse generated quiz JSON"

**Possible Causes:**

### Generated Quiz Won't Import
