## Edge Cases Handled

- ✅ User with no friends - Shows empty state
- ✅ User with no badges - Shows all as locked
- ✅ User with no quiz attempts - Shows empty activity
- ✅ No notifications - Shows "all caught up"
- ✅ No pending requests - Shows empty states
- ✅ Invalid user ID - Redirects to home
- ✅ Unauthenticated user - Navigation shows sign in
- ✅ Mobile responsive - All layouts adapt

---

## Performance Considerations

### Data Fetching
- Parallel API calls with `Promise.all`
- Pagination on lists
- Selective field projection
- Cached topic hierarchies

### UI Optimizations
- Conditional rendering for empty states
- Loading spinners during fetch
- Optimistic updates where appropriate
- Lazy loading for images

2. Implement challenge creation from friend card
3. Add pagination to activity feed
4. Real-time notification updates
5. Friend activity stream

### Future Features
1. Privacy settings (hide stats, profile visibility)
2. Block user functionality
3. Friend recommendations
4. Activity timeline
5. Social sharing buttons
