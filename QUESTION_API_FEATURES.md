# Question API Features - Complete Guide

## ✅ All Your Questions Answered

Based on your requirements, here's what's implemented and how to use it:

---

## 1. ✅ Get Question by ID

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/questions/[id]`

**Features:**
- Returns complete question details
- Includes all answers with correct answer marked
- Shows topic information
- Lists all quizzes using this question
- Requires admin authentication

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "cm123...",
    "type": "MULTIPLE_CHOICE",
    "difficulty": "EASY",
    "questionText": "How many players in a cricket team?",
    "hint": "Think of standard team size",
    "explanation": "A cricket team has 11 players",
    "randomizeAnswerOrder": false,
    "topic": {
      "id": "cm...",
      "name": "Cricket",
      "slug": "cricket"
    },
    "answers": [
      {
        "id": "cm...",
        "answerText": "11",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "displayOrder": 0
      },
      {
        "answerText": "10",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "displayOrder": 1
      }
    ],
    "quizPools": [
      {
        "quiz": {
          "title": "Cricket Basics",
          "slug": "cricket-basics"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 2. ✅ Get Questions by Topic AND Difficulty

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/questions`

**Supported Filters:**

| Filter | Parameter | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Topic ID | `topicId` | `?topicId=cm123...` |
| Difficulty | `difficulty` | `?difficulty=EASY` |
| Question Type | `type` | `?type=MULTIPLE_CHOICE` |
| Search | `search` | `?search=championship` |

### Example Queries

**All EASY Cricket questions:**
```bash
# First, get Cricket topic ID
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/topics' | jq '.data.topics[] | select(.slug == "cricket") | .id'

# Then filter questions
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/admin/questions?topicId={cricket-id}&difficulty=EASY'
```

**All HARD questions (any topic):**
```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/admin/questions?difficulty=HARD'
```

**MEDIUM Basketball questions:**
```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/admin/questions?topicId={basketball-id}&difficulty=MEDIUM'
```

**Multiple filters combined:**
```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/admin/questions?topicId={id}&difficulty=EASY&type=MULTIPLE_CHOICE&limit=10'
```

---

## 3. ✅ Randomize Question Order for a Quiz

**Implementation**: Automatic during quiz attempt

**How It Works:**

### Step 1: Configure Quiz
When creating a quiz, set:
```json
{
  "randomizeQuestionOrder": true
}
```

### Step 2: Automatic Randomization
When a user starts the quiz (`POST /api/attempts`):
```typescript
// Code from app/api/attempts/route.ts (lines 106-109)
if (quiz.randomizeQuestionOrder) {
  selectedQuestions = selectedQuestions.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);
}
```

### Step 3: Each Attempt is Different
- User A starts quiz → Questions: [Q1, Q3, Q2, Q5, Q4]
- User B starts quiz → Questions: [Q4, Q1, Q5, Q2, Q3]
- User A retakes → Questions: [Q2, Q4, Q1, Q3, Q5]

**Every attempt has a unique question order!**

### Benefits
- Prevents answer memorization
- Fair competition (everyone gets same questions, different order)
- Reduces cheating
- More engaging for repeat attempts

### Testing

```javascript
// 1. Create quiz with randomization
POST /api/admin/quizzes
{
  "title": "Randomized NBA Quiz",
  "randomizeQuestionOrder": true,
  "questionSelectionMode": "FIXED"
}

// 2. Add 5 questions to quiz pool

// 3. Start attempt #1
POST /api/attempts { "quizId": "..." }
// Returns: [Q3, Q1, Q5, Q2, Q4]

// 4. Start attempt #2  
POST /api/attempts { "quizId": "..." }
// Returns: [Q2, Q5, Q1, Q4, Q3] ← Different order!
```

---

## 4. ✅ Randomize Answer Options Order for a Question

**Implementation**: Per-question configuration

**How It Works:**

### Step 1: Configure Question
When creating a question, set:
```json
{
  "questionText": "Who won the 2023 NBA Championship?",
  "randomizeAnswerOrder": true,
  "answers": [
    {"answerText": "Denver Nuggets", "isCorrect": true, "displayOrder": 0},
    {"answerText": "Miami Heat", "isCorrect": false, "displayOrder": 1},
    {"answerText": "Lakers", "isCorrect": false, "displayOrder": 2},
    {"answerText": "Celtics", "isCorrect": false, "displayOrder": 3}
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Automatic Randomization
When starting quiz attempt:
```typescript
// Code from app/api/attempts/route.ts (lines 146-151)
answers: q.answers.sort((a, b) => 
  q.randomizeAnswerOrder 
    ? Math.random() - 0.5        // Randomize
    : a.displayOrder - b.displayOrder  // Use displayOrder
)
```

### Step 3: Different for Each Attempt
- Attempt 1: [A, C, D, B]  ← Correct answer in position 1
- Attempt 2: [C, A, B, D]  ← Correct answer in position 2
- Attempt 3: [D, B, A, C]  ← Correct answer in position 3

**The correct answer appears in random positions!**

### Benefits
- Users can't memorize "answer is always B"
- Forces actual knowledge, not pattern recognition
- More challenging and fair
- Can be enabled per-question (mix randomized and fixed)

### Mixed Configuration Example

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "questionText": "Easy memory question",
      "randomizeAnswerOrder": false,  // Keep order
      "answers": [...]
    },
    {
      "questionText": "Challenging question",
      "randomizeAnswerOrder": true,   // Randomize
      "answers": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Advanced Features

### A. Topic Hierarchy Support

When filtering by topic, **child topics are automatically included**:

```bash
# Topics: Sports > Cricket > Batting > Techniques

# Filter by "Cricket" includes:
# - Cricket questions
# - Batting questions  
# - Techniques questions
# (All descendants automatically included!)
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// app/api/attempts/route.ts (lines 72-74)
const topics = await getDescendantTopics(config.topicId);
const topicIds = [config.topicId, ...topics.map((t) => t.id)];
```

### B. Random Question Selection from Topics

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/attempts` with `TOPIC_RANDOM` mode

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "questionSelectionMode": "TOPIC_RANDOM",
  "topicConfigs": [
    {"topicId": "cricket-id", "difficulty": "EASY", "questionCount": 5},
    {"topicId": "cricket-id", "difficulty": "HARD", "questionCount": 3},
    {"topicId": "basketball-id", "difficulty": "MEDIUM", "questionCount": 2}
  ]
}
```

**Result:**
- 5 EASY cricket questions (random from pool)
- 3 HARD cricket questions (random from pool)
- 2 MEDIUM basketball questions (random from pool)
- Total: 10 questions, uniquely selected each time

### C. Question Statistics Tracking

Each question automatically tracks:
```json
{
  "timesAnswered": 147,  // How many times attempted
  "timesCorrect": 89     // How many times correct
}
```

**Calculated success rate:** 89/147 = 60.5%

Used for:
- Question difficulty calibration
- Identifying problematic questions
- Analytics dashboard

## Practical Testing Guide

### Test 1: Topic-Based Filtering

```bash
# Step 1: Get all topics
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/topics' | jq '.data.topics'

# Step 2: Pick a topic ID (e.g., Cricket)
CRICKET_ID="cm..."

# Step 3: Get all Cricket questions
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/questions?topicId=${CRICKET_ID}"

# Step 4: Get only EASY Cricket questions
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/questions?topicId=${CRICKET_ID}&difficulty=EASY"
```

### Test 2: Difficulty Filtering

```bash
# Get all EASY questions
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/admin/questions?difficulty=EASY'

# Get all HARD questions  
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/admin/questions?difficulty=HARD'

# Get MEDIUM questions, page 1
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/admin/questions?difficulty=MEDIUM&page=1&limit=10'
```

### Test 3: Randomization Testing

```javascript
// Create a quiz with randomization
const quiz = await fetch('/api/admin/quizzes', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: 'Test Randomization',
    randomizeQuestionOrder: true,
    // ... other fields
  })
});

// Create questions with randomized answers
const question = await fetch('/api/admin/questions', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    questionText: 'Test question?',
    topicId: 'cricket-id',
    randomizeAnswerOrder: true,
    answers: [
      { answerText: 'Correct', isCorrect: true },
      { answerText: 'Wrong 1', isCorrect: false },
      { answerText: 'Wrong 2', isCorrect: false },
    ]
  })
});

// Start multiple attempts - each will have different order
const attempt1 = await fetch('/api/attempts', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ quizId: quiz.id })
});

const attempt2 = await fetch('/api/attempts', {
  method: 'POST',  
  body: JSON.stringify({ quizId: quiz.id })
});

// Compare attempt1.questions vs attempt2.questions
// Order will be different!
```

## Real Database Example (From Your Seeded Data)

Based on the seed script, you have:

**Topics:**
- Sports (0 questions)
  - Cricket (1 question)
    - Batting (1 question)
    - Bowling (1 question)
  - Basketball (0 questions)
    - NBA (0 questions)

**Test with Real IDs:**
```bash
# Get Cricket topic ID
CRICKET_ID=$(curl -s 'http://localhost:3000/api/topics' | jq -r '.data.topics[] | select(.slug == "cricket") | .id')

# Get all Cricket questions (should include Batting + Bowling)
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/questions?topicId=${CRICKET_ID}"

# Get only EASY Cricket questions
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/questions?topicId=${CRICKET_ID}&difficulty=EASY"
```

## Recommendation for Testing

Since admin endpoints require authentication, I recommend:

### Option 1: Use Prisma Studio
```bash
npx prisma studio
```
Browse questions, topics, and see the relationships visually.

### Option 2: Create Test via API Docs
Once you sign in as admin, you can use the admin panel to:
1. Create topics
2. Create questions
3. Test filtering
4. See randomization in action

### Option 3: Integration Tests
Write automated tests (coming next in the plan) that:
- Create test data
- Test all filters
- Verify randomization
- Check topic hierarchy
