## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Next.js 15 with App Router**: Latest stable version, server components by default
2. **Prisma with PostgreSQL**: Type-safe database access, excellent DX
3. **NextAuth v5**: Most mature auth solution for Next.js
4. **Shadcn/ui**: Customizable, accessible components
5. **Zod**: Runtime validation with type inference
6. **Server-side rendering**: Better SEO and initial load performance
7. **Atomic database operations**: Transactions for data consistency
8. **Soft delete for quizzes**: Archive instead of hard delete

## Notes

- All API endpoints use proper error handling
- Authentication middleware protects admin routes
- Database operations are optimized with proper indexes
- Question randomization uses array shuffling (can be improved with Prisma extensions)
- Topic hierarchy uses recursive traversal (may need optimization for deep trees)
- Leaderboard rankings are recalculated on each update (consider background job for scale)
- File uploads ready for Supabase Storage integration
- Recurring quiz refresh logic needs cron/scheduled task implementation
